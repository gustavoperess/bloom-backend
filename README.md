<p>Welcome to the BLOOM Backend, the powerhouse behind the BLOOM social media platform. This API offers more than 40 callable functions, designed to seamlessly integrate with the <a href="https://github.com/gustavoperess/bloom-frontend">BLOOM Frontend</a>, creating a comprehensive experience for plant owners seeking assistance in caring for their plants during extended absences.</p>

<p>BLOOM is more than just a social media platform; it's a community where plant enthusiasts can share tips, offer care for each other's plants, and connect over their shared green interests. Whether you're on vacation or away on business, BLOOM ensures your plants are in good hands.</p>

<p>To get started with the BLOOM platform, check out the deployed version here: <a href="https://bloom-frontend-vryp.onrender.com/">BLOOM</a>.</p>
